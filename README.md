# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
# modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
# pvpscript's build
This fork contains my own changes to the `config.h` file, building my own statusbar with my personal signaling changes.
